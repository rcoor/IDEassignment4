        <h4>Principal Component Analysis of hands</h4>

        <p>We, the human race are quite alike. We have all heard the phrase that we are 99.9% the same – although that this
            is disputed it is clear that we carry a higher resembles between each other than for example to a Chimpanzee.</p>
        <p>It is this fact that makes all our small differences even more interesting – we have a very clear basis of comparison.
            In this example we have <strong>40 individual hands</strong> each outlined by 56 points. Each comes as a set of x- and y-coordinates
            that can be visualized in a scatter-plot as points. </p>
        <p>In the example below we can see that there is a clear difference between some of the shown hands. This might be due
            to different characteristics of the hands or way the hand was placed when it was drawn.</p>
        <p>Below is a plot of the 40 individual hands, where the hands get highlighted if marked in the PCA scatter plot.</p>

        <p>
            It's difficult for the human eye to extract any meaningful correlation from a plot as show above.<br/>
            To make it easier to analyse we made an interactive scatterplot showing the PCAs using only the first two features.<br/>
            A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used in order to do a deeper analysis of features. For instance
            we can see if some hand gestures are similar to each other. This could be useful if we had a list of hand gestures
            and its meaning, then we could use PCA to find out what a given hand gesture meant.</p>

        <h4>All hands on deck, a PCA plot</h4>
        <p>As we can see on below scatterplot, there are no clearly visible clusters among the 40 hands.</p>

        </svg>
        <p>By selecting a point on the PCA we get the corresponding hand drawn on the other plot. Selection can be done by
            clicking a point or by dragging in the container and selecting multiple points. They corresponding hand is drawn
            in the box to the right (desktop) or below (mobile). At the same time the hand(s) is/are highlighted in the plot above.</p>
        <p>
            It seems that hands on the right side of the PCA the hands are more dense compared to the hands on the left side.
            On the top it seems the the right-most fingers are more spread and at the bottom it seems that the left-most fingers
            are more spread and the right-most fingers are more together.
        </p>

        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <p>Individual part: the 40 hands shown at once is made by Theis Jakobsen and the id shown when hovering points are made
            by Christian Grüner. Everything else is made together.</p>
