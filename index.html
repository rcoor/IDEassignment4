        <h4>Principal Component Analysis of hands</h4>
        <p>We, the human race are quite alike. We have all heard the phrase that we are 99.9% the same – although that this
            is disputed it is clear that we carry a higher resembles between each other than for example to a Chimpanzee.</p>
        <p>It is this fact that makes all our small differences even more interesting – we have a very clear basis of comparison.
            In this example we have <strong>40 individual outlines</strong> of hands. Each comes as a set of x- and y-coordinates
            that can be visualized in a scatter-plot as points. </p>
        <p>In the example below we can see that there is a clear difference between some of the shown hands. This might be due
            to different characteristics of the hands or way the hand was placed when it was drawn.</p>

        <p>It's difficult for the human eye to extract any meaningful correlation from a plot as show above. A Principal Component
            Analysis (PCA) can be used in order to do a deeper analysis of features. </p>

        <h4>All hands on deck, a PCA plot</h4>
        <p>There are no clearly visible clusters among the 40 hands.</p>

        <p>By selecting a point on the PCA we get the corresponding hand drawn on the other plot.</p>
        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <p>Individual part: the 40 hands shown at once is made by Theis Jakobsen and the id shown when hovering points are made
            by Christian Grüner. Everything else is made together.</p>
